# About the app
[Ocipe](https://ocipe.vercel.app) is basically a digital personal cookbook with a built-in grocery planner targets in making the whole process "easier"

I love cooking, but deciding what to eat and buy from 50+ saved recipes across apps, bookmarks, screenshots? Yeah… when life gets busy, that’s quite a nightmare.

So hey, let make an actual software with cool feature to organise and make the process better.

## Cookbook
The idea are quite simple innit?

Cookbook are where all the recipes, instructions are written down to help you when cooking. 
Here's the catch: someone's gotta write them down first. And in this app, you are the manager, the writer.

Unlike physical cookbook, here you can search it by many means:
+ Can't remember its name? Search by meat types or even ingredients.
+ Can't bother buying new grocery? Find what you can cook with what you have.
  
## Grocery Planner
Thinking what to buy for one specific recipe might be easily done in our head. However, when it comes to recipes for the whole week, it can be a lot.

Some very simple feature include
+ A fridge components to organise what ingredients you have - for accurate grocery list
+ A random selection to help in indecisive moments
+ A view of what you have planned - if repetiveness is not your cup of tea
